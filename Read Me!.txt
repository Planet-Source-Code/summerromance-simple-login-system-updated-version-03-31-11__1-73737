* Note: if all the users were blocked simply open the database and create an account under the 
[T_ID_numbers] and [T_users_acct] table (make sure you fill up all the fields and both the IDnumber 
on both tables are exactly the same). [important] go to module "DatabaseAccess" delete line 69 and 70
or simply go to [T_users_acct] under the acctStatus field change "Locked" to "Active".
